1. No, I do not. 
I only learnt how to use Dreamweaver (not using code) during my tertiary study back in my hometown around 7-8 years ago. (I do not think it counts)
I always think that coding is very interesting, however, I missed the chance to study it as me and my parents thought it might be a better option to study business related subjects instead.
In the future, I want to build my own website and applications and make good money in this industry.
I tried to do some self-learning but I was lost with too much information.
I know the easiest way to acquire right knowledge is studying in a proper school, and that is why I am here!

2. To my understanding, a C text file is instructions that can only be understood by human but not machines.
It involve a lot more instructions and processes behind the scenes, which includes preprocessing (generates .i file), compiling (generates .s file), assembling (generates .o file) and linking (generates .exe file).
When it turn .c file into .i during preprocessing stage, the command <stdio.h> actually expanded into many more lines of instruction for helping the computer to process. 
The compiler "gcc" that we type in the matrix, in fact, is a program that can help us to connect linker and assembler, step by step compiling a .c file into a .exe file.

3. As I am starting from zero, understanding the basics of how to communicate with a computer (the basic codes) or what is inside a computer are important.
I believe the course is already providing useful information for us such as the videos and readings. 
Furthermore, knowing the direction of what kind of knowledge that I need to acquire for my future goals (apps writing, or maybe becoming a full stack developer) is also a major concern.
I hope I will find it fun, build confident and build a strong foundation knowledge for the later courses!
